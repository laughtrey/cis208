### Textbook: PC Assembly Language Paul A. Carter, 2006
### Fall '19
##### Final grade: 

[Continued from CIS 83](https://laughtrey.github.io/cis83/)

## Projects

### 1 First Program 
>First assembly program, working with the template structure of a .asm file and changing a string value data around
>I think assembly will be complicated, but I'm also excited to see how much of a deeper understanding I gain of 
>different programming exercises from learning it.

### 1.1 Arithmetic Expression
>Simple arirtmetic expressions using the registers. It's not as easy as it looks, but I thought of each register as being it's own set of parenthesis. A small set of memory itself!

### 1.2 asm_io Functions
>Using stuff like print_char and print_int that is 'built in' to our book. We're going to make these on our own later, but for now they're convenient. 

### 2 Control and Loops
>This week was a little different, if-else statements in assembly are somewhat complicated and counterintuitive at first, and I don't know if I did it correctly or not 'yet'.
