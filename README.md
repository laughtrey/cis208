[Continued from CIS 83](https://laughtrey.github.io/cis83/)

## Projects

### 1 First Program 
>First assembly program, working with the template structure of a .asm file and changing a string value data around
>I think assembly will be complicated, but I'm also excited to see how much of a deeper understanding I gain of 
>different programming exercises from learning it.

### 1.1 Arithmetic Expression
>Simple arirtmetic expressions using the registers. It's not as easy as it looks, but I thought of each register as being it's own set of parenthesis. A small set of memory itself!

### 1.2 asm_io Functions
>Using stuff like print_char and print_int that is 'built in' to our book. We're going to make these on our own later, but for now they're convenient. 

### 2.1 Control and Loops
>This week was a little different, if-else statements in assembly are somewhat complicated and counterintuitive at first, and I don't know if I did it correctly or not 'yet'.

### 2.2 Control and Loops
>More control functions, looping, while loops and if loops. To be honest, I think I messed up on the sum of odd numbers between two given points, I couldn't think of a way to do that
>in a loop yet.

### 3 Bit Operations
>I started visuallizing shift and rotate like moving a rubiks cube around, because the one thing I can think about using these functions for is encryption or cryptology.
>If you know the correct order to UN-shift the bits and get the correct info, you can decrypt what information you need. I need to read more on this though. 

### 4 Subprograms
>I spent entirely too long trying to create a subprogram inside of main. Why would I do that? Functions exist outside of the main driver always. 
>This is the part where you really respect compilers and what they're doing, pushing paramters to the stack is tedious and I can't imagine more than a few.

### 5 Arrays
>Arrays weren't very hard, especially if you use EDI and ESI and their built in pneumonic functions. STOS_ and LODS_ were incredibly useful. 

### Final
>It wasn't difficult at all since I spent so much time messing with arrays with the last project. I'm going to go back and see if I can do the same thing with the float and math coprocessor.
